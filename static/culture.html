FRST Culture

Culture is a commonly-heard word in the world of teams in modern times, but to many it is only that: a word.
Oftentimes the symptoms of poor culture are felt long before athletes, or even coaches are able to understand
the nature of the underlying problems. One of FRST's core values is the importance of constantly striving
to promote great culture: in other words, the creation of an atmosphere where passion, fun, and family are held
in the highest regard, and excellence is not a wish or a hope, but an expectation. Here is our recipe:

The Three C's of Culture:

Communication
"The most valuable of all talents is that of never using two words when one will do."
The world of swimming has its own language, with many different dialects. FRST believes in the importance of
common language between athletes and coach. Whether it be communicating the main purpose, or structure of a
practice by its "color," or using the GAIN system's modular structure to quickly and effectively communicate
complex movement patterns, our coaches and athletes establish a shared vocabulary to ensure less time is spent
explaining practices than ensuring that they are the highest quality they can be week in and week out.

Consistency
"Variety may be the spice of life, but the quality of a diet is not judged on it spices."
An important facilitator of the communication system above is our commitment to consistency. While many coaches
and athletes get "bored" of seeing similar sets or repeated workouts, FRST maintains common threads through much
of the season in order to promote focus on progress and improvement. This allows the athletes to become familiar
with the expectations of them, and see themselves grow week to week, rather than feeling that progress is only
made when meets come around.

Candor
"Pretty words are not always true, and true words are not always pretty."
Relationships are a key part of what makes FRST special, and relationships are built on trust. FRST believes in
the value of honesty and openness, even when sometimes they come at the cost of our feelings in the short term.
Learning to stray from the comfortable as we discover our path to greatness is what ultimately allows us to grow
and form the skills and relationships that outlast our time in the pool.
