        <b>How good must a swimmer be to join FRST?</b>

        It depends on the swimmer's age:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>10 or younger:</b> Must be able to swim 50 yards unassisted
            freestyle

          <li>
            <b>11-14 years old:</b> Must be able to complete several lengths of
            the pool without stopping.

          Schools?</b

        <br />
        <i>No.</i> FRST does not discriminate based on school/disctrict
        affiliation, or location of residence. FRST regularly serves athletes
        from Bloomington, Columbus, various parts of Johnson County and even
        around the metro Indianapolis area.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>When can my athlete join FRST?</b><br />Athletes are able to join
        FRST any time throughout the year. The primary "season breaks" are at
        the end of March, and end of July at which point we host a dedicated
        evaluation night for new families, but evaluations can be scheduled at
        any time. Email daily@frstswimming.com (10&Under) or
        purcell@frstswimming.com (11-14) to set up an evaluation.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>What are the costs involved with FRST?</b><br />Costs depend on the
        training group of the athlete. As athletes progress and move to groups
        with more practices, membership dues increase, but price per session
        decreases drastically. We regularly host swim meets at the FCHS pool in
        order to help subsidize our costs and keep our dues as low as possible!
      </li>
      <li>
        <b
          >What if an athlete participates in other sports or
          extra-curriculars?</b
        ><br />FRST takes great pride in offering a "program for everyone" and
        we understand the need for well-rounded individuals. Each athlete has
        the opportunity to attend a multitude of offered practices throughout
        the week and can participate in swimming alongside their other
        endeavors.

        <b>Are there required suits/caps/apparel?</b><br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Suits:</b> FRST offers a team suit each season, available in the
            Team Store (through Elsmore Swim Shop).

            <b>Caps:</b> FRST caps are REQUIRED for all COMPETITIONS.
            Personalized silicon caps are available for purchase at the

          <li>
            <b>Apparel:</b> Each season, included in registration are two team
            T-shirts which are used as team apparel for competition. Other FRST

          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Where does FRST practice?</b><br />FRST practices primarily out of
        two facilities:
        <ul>
          <li><b>Franklin Commuity High School</b> 8-lane, 50 meter pool</li>
          <li><b>Franklin Community Middle School</b> 6-lane 25 yard pool</li>
        </ul>
        Occasionally we will utilize other facilities, such as
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Franklin Family Aquatic Center</b> 6-lane, 50 meter outdoor pool
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>When & How does one swim in meets?</b><br />FRST believes strongly in
        the importance of meets as the bedrock of swimming. Not only are they a
        metric of progress, they are a fun way to spend time with teammates,
        meet new people, and learn important lessons that go beyond the pool!
        FRST requires home meets for all levels of the competitive team, with a
        season of leniency for those new to the team. Take a look at our Meet
        Info page for more on which meets are appropriate, how to sign up, and
        anything else you might need to know.

        <b>How are training groups decided?</b><br />Many things are considered
        by coaches in placing athletes, such as meet performance, practice
        attendance, stroke mechanics, attitude, etc.<br />However, for a simple
        reference
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Introductory (<i>Spark & Discovery</i>):</b> Water-safe &
            comfortable swimming multiple lengths of the pool
          </li>
          <li>
