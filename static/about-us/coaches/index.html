        Zach enters his 13th year as Head Coach & Owner at FRST Swimming.
        Serving in a role of Club Director, Zach works predominantly with the
        Senior Group. Zach has been a transformative leader for the FRST
        program, striving each day to improve our clubs’ athletes as athletes
        and people. FRST has reaped the rewards, going quickly from a team
        that wasn’t in the top-25 in the VCC ranking within Indiana to as high
        as 5th recently within our state.
      </p>
      <p>
        Coach DeWitt took over a very young FRST program, who had never even
        qualified an athlete for Junior Nationals in 2013. In 2014, the club
        qualified its 1st athlete for Speedo Junior Nationals (Adam
        Destrampe). In the winter of 2018, FRST had 11 athletes at Winter
        Junior Nationals. DeWitt’s athletes have won over 50 individual state
        titles and have broken 8 Indiana Association Records. FRST has
        finished within the top 5 at both the Senior State and Age Group State
        level within the last 3 years, which we believe is an indication of
        sustained success.
      </p>
      <p>
        Zach is also the Head Coach at Franklin Community High School. He’s
        helped turn around a program that hadn’t won a sectional title in 27
        years (boys & girls) to becoming a perennial sectional title winner.
        The Franklin Boys have won the past 9 years in a row (2013-2021),
        while the girls have won the last 6 years (2016-2021). Recently, the
        girls finished as 2nd place at the 2019 IHSAA State Championships,
        while the boys won their 2nd Runner-Up trophy in as many years, behind
        Carmel High School. DeWitt has been selected as Indiana High School
        Coach of the Year twice (Boys - 2018, Girls - 2019).
      </p>
      <p>
        Coach DeWitt has spent quite a lot of time in helping with Indiana
        Swimming camps and development. DeWitt was selected for the 2016
        Senior Elite Development Camp as well has the 2017 Indiana Swimming
        Olympic Training Center Camp. FRST has hosted an Age Group Divisional
        Camp in 2015, where DeWitt was instrumental in organizing the
        programming.
      </p>
      <p>
        Zach lives in Martinsville with his wife, Ruby, his son Charlie, and
        his Bernese Mountain dog, Friar. Outside the pool he is a financial advisor with Edward Jones and
        enjoys traveling, cultures, and his hometown sports teams.

        Colin has been coaching with FRST for 5 years after joining the
        Franklin Community High School staff as a part-time volunteer in
        November 2018. Colin started his coaching career in West Lafayette as
        an age group, senior, and high school coach with FISH Aquatics and
        West Lafayette High School. Between West Lafayette, Lafayette and
        Franklin Colin has coached many state and zone finalists in his first
        few years.
      </p>

      <p>
        In Colin's time at Franklin, its Age Group program has seen several team Top
        10 finishes at the Age Group State meet. He helped the team navigate
        the struggles and complexities of the COVID-19 pandemic and led the
        team to its first Top 10 finish in over 5 years at the 2021
        championships. He has coached athletes to State, Zone and Junior
        National qualifications.
      </p>

      <p>
        As an Engineering graduate of Purdue University, Colin brings a wealth
        of knowledge and a trememndous work ethic for our athletes, which is
        an invaluable resource to FRST. Colin's analytical approach, combined
        with his technical expertise, allow him to help athletes build
        technical foundations that allow them to succeed at all levels of the
        sport.
      </p>

      <p>
        When Colin&#39;s not on the deck coaching, he spends his time working
        as an electrical engineer, and searching for ways to help FRST take
        its next steps toward being a perennially dominant force in Indiana
        Swimming. He still enjoys competing in triathlons and swimming when he
        can, and enjoys hobbies such as rock climbing and skydiving in the
        warmer months.
      </p>

      <p>
        During his swimming career Colin represented Avon High School,
        Zionsville Swim Club, and Purdue as a breaststroke specialist. He went
        on to swim after college, competing in several National Championship
        meets, before hanging up his suit in 2019 to focus on coaching.

        Paul is entering his 4th with the FRST Family after having
        spent 5 years as the Head Age Group Coach of FISH Aquatics in West
        Lafayette, Indiana. In Lafayette he worked with many levels of
        swimmer, from athletes joining a swim team for the first time to 11-14
        year old state qualifiers, finalists, and champions. His experience
        and expertise has shown quickly, coaching a state championship
        performance in his first season, and advancing FRST's 10& under
        program from qualifying no state athletes in the previous 2 years to 5
        new qualifiers (and counting) in just more than his first year.
      </p>
      <p>
        Paul focuses on establishing a love for the sport of swimming by
        making it fun while instilling strong fundamentals at a young age. He
        embraces the philosophy of “Technique under Duress” where he steps up
        the training to prepare those athletes for state and zone level
        competitions all while maintaining a focus on proper technique.
      </p>
      <p>
        Paul is in his 7th year of coaching having worked with athletes
        ranging from learn-to-swim through senior level swimmers. He is an
        ASCA Level 2 certified coach and has served on several Team Indiana
        Staffs for camps and zone meets. He is also heavily involved in the
        governance side of the sport as he serves in roles with both Indiana
        Swimming and USA Swimming where he was recognized with the 2015 Safe
        Sport National Impact Award, the first athlete to receive this honor.
      </p>
      <p>
        Paul lives in West Lafayette, Indiana and attends Purdue University
        where he has earned two Bachelors degrees in Aerospace and Nuclear
        Engineering in addition to a Masters degree in Nuclear Engineering
        focusing on nuclear space propulsion. He is passionate about his
        research, so when he is not coaching or working on swimming
        governance, he is continuing his research in computational thermal
        hydrualics (essentially the physics of bubbles) while pursuing his PhD
        in Nuclear Engineering. In the rare free time that Paul does have, he
        enjoys going on adventures with friends, being outside in his hammock,
        working on his jeep and watching Netflix.
      </p>
      <p>
        Paul swam his club career for the Suburban Seahawks club near
        Philadelphia, PA under legendary coach Charlie Kennedy before
        continuing his career at Purdue University before a shoulder injury
        led him into coaching.

        Griffin Edwards begins his 4th year with Franklin Regional
        Team after a 3 year stint as Head Age Group Coach at the Avon
        Community Swim Team. While Griffin’s enthusiasm and passion for
        swimming is great, it’s his team-first approach in helping athletes
        that shines through. Coach Griffin’s contributions to the ACST program
        were immense during his time. In just a couple short years, ACST
        improved a great deal from 2019 to 2021 as evidenced by their finish
        at the State Championships.

      </ul>

      <p>
        Griffin’s love for FRST and Franklin swimming go back to 2015 when he
        became part of the Franklin Regional Swim Team family. During his time
        here, he grew both as a leader and a teammate. He received the Grizzly
        Cub Leadership Award twice and was one of the passionate leaders that
        spearheaded the 2018, 2019 Franklin IHSAA State Runner-Up teams.
        Individually, Griffin was a Junior National qualifier in the 200
        Butterfly and a valued Junior National Relay athlete. Griffin also won
        a state title in the 800 Free Relay, and was a consistent Top 16
        qualifier at the IHSAA State Championships.
      </p>

      <p>
        Griffin hopes to help FRST in becoming a consistent Top-5 Age Group
        Program, and developing athletes to become not only better swimmers,
        but better people. When he’s not on the pool deck, you can find
        Griffin listening to podcasts and reading articles to further his
        knowledge. He loves to spend time with his family and play with his
        German Shepherd, “Swaggy.”

        Madi has been with FRST for almost 5 years, after joining to coach the
        Discovery Group in 2020. Madi's experience with club swimming began
        with FRST from 2011-2015. As a former distance swimmer, Madi brings a
        great deal of enthusiasm and passion for the sport of swimming to
        FRST. She's been a dynamic leader of the Discovery and Endeavour
        groups, where her energy is infectious.

      <span class="quote">
        <p>
          FRST is more than just a swim team, it is a family. I love getting
          to work with the kids every day, as well as interacting with the
          coaches, parents, and lifeguards. From my first season of coaching,
          I have seen tremendous growth in our Discovery athletes in the way
          that they view themselves and the world of swimming. I am really
          excited to continue my journey this summer with the 11-14 groups!
        </p>

        <p>
          I love creating fun practices for this age group, whether we are
          playing games in the water or spinning the wheel for a surprise
          practice. It is fun to keep these kids on their toes about ‘what's
          next’ and keeping them engaged in the swimming world.
