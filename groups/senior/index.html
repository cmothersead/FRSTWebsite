      <h2>High Performance Senior (HPSR)</h2>

      <h3>Lead Coach: Zach DeWitt</h3>

      <p>
        This is the highest-level competitive group that FRST offers. This group
        has been assembled to provide our athletes with every possible advantage
        to succeed at the highest level. The group is recommended for swimmers
        14 and over who wish to participate in Sectional, National and
        potentially International competitions with a strong emphasis on USA
        Junior Nationals, NCSA Junior Nationals, and USA Senior Nationals. This
        high intensity/high reward group trains
        <u>8-9 pool practices a week, with 3 dryland practices per week</u> and
        offers a structured comprehensive strength program. College swimming is
        another main objective of swimmers in the FRST High Performance Group
        and assistance with the recruiting process is offered to all group
        members. HPSR also places a strong emphasis on community service, giving
        back to and being leaders of FRST.

      <h2>Senior 1 (SR1)</h2>

      <h3>Lead Coach: Colin Mothersead</h3>

      <p>
        Senior 1 (SR1) is for ages 14-18 who are already at or very close to the
        State level, and whose goal is ultimately to obtain Speedo
        Sectionals/Futures qualifying times and move to our High-Performance
        Senior Group. This is another high intensity/high reward group that
        trains
        <u>7-8 pool practices a week, with 3 dryland practices per week.</u>
        This group offers a comprehensive strength program geared toward
        critical movements and mobility for the sport. Our SR1 group is highly
        technical, and focused on the three main areas of improvement in
        swimming: Technique, Strength, and Endurance. During summer, there are 8
        pool practices per week, with 3 dryland practices per week, similar to
        HPSR.
