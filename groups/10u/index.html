      FRST's Age Group program aims to offer the most complete, progress-driven
      program possible by teaching not only the physical skills specific to the
      sport, but by creating a team environment where excellence, effort, and
      enthusiasm are highly valued. Whether you are just getting into swimming
      in middle school or have been in the water since before you could walk,
      there is a place in these groups that allow you to improve quickly, and
      most importantly - <strong>HAVE FUN</strong>!
