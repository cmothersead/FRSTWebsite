<p><strong>FRST Senior Group Mission Statement &amp; Group Descriptions</strong></p>

<p><em>&quot;Franklin Regional Swim Team&rsquo;s goal is to become the most innovative, athlete-centered, program in our
        state.&nbsp; With an &ldquo;athlete-centered&rdquo; goal in place, our coaches have designed a system to make
        our athletes successful at all levels within our sport. Athletes will receive instruction, as well as
        training, based specifically on their needs as an athlete. Outstanding achievement and vast improvement is our
        goal for <u>all of our FRST athletes</u>.&quot;</em></p>

<h2>High Performance Senior (HPSR)</h2>

<h3>Lead Coach: Zach DeWitt</h3>

<p>This is the highest-level competitive group that FRST offers. This group has been assembled in the Summer LCM Season
    2015 to provide our athletes with every possible advantage in succeeding at the highest level. The group is
    recommended for swimmers 14 and over who wish to participate in Sectional, National and potentially International
    competitions with a strong emphasis on USA Junior Nationals, NCSA, and Nationals. This high intensity/ high reward
    group trains <u>8-9 pool practices a week, with 3 dryland practices per week</u> and offers a structured
    comprehensive strength program. Swimming in college is another main objective of swimmers in the FRST High
    Performance Group and assistance with the recruiting process is offered to all group members. There is also a strong
    emphasis on community service as well as giving back to and being leaders of FRST.</p>
