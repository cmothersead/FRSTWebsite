    <p>
      It is our goal to become the most <strong>innovative</strong>,
      <strong>athlete-centered</strong> program in our state. With an
      “athlete-centered” goal in place, our coaches have designed a system to
      make our athletes successful at all levels within our sport. Athletes will
      receive instruction, as well as training, based specifically on their
      needs as an athlete. With long-term success always in mind, FRST will
      offer an excellent experience for all ages of our athletes. Outstanding
      achievement and vast improvement will always be our priority.
