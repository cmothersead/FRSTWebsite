      FRST's Age Group program teaches not only the physical skills necessary
      for the sport of swimming, but also aims to create a team environment
      where excellence, effort, and enthusiasm are highly valued. The 11-14
      groups are central to this mission. All of these groups spend time and
      effort to create an atmosphere each day where the necessary steps to
      pursue exellence are not only accepted, but championed!

    <p>
      We are one of the highest achieving programs in any sport in our area
      because of our commitment to these values. Whether you are a middle
      schooler looking to join your school team for the first time or have been
      in the water since before you could walk, there is a place in these groups
      that allow you to improve quickly, learn a lot, and most importantly -
      <strong>HAVE FUN</strong>!
