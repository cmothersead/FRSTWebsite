        <h1>Founder</h1>
        <h2>Brett Findley</h2>
    </div>
</div>

<p>
    Brett Findley founded the <strong>Franklin Regional Swim Team</strong> in the fall of 2007. The club originated from a need in the Franklin area for a high level of competitive swimming. At the time, <strong>FRST</strong> was the only coach owned
    swim team in south-central Indiana, so the concept was quite new. Brett wanted to create a team that was truly athlete centered, coach driven, and parent supported.
</p>

<p>With this area never having fostered a USA Swimming Club, Brett had a steep hill to climb to prove that his team could be successful. Within just a couple years, Brett's club had moved it's way up the Indiana Swimming rankings, while also producing a
    couple state champion swimmers. Coach Findley, after many successful seasons and building a great staff, moved on to his next life adventure as a principal in the Columbus, IN area.

        <h1>Head Coach/Owner</h1>
        <h2>Zach DeWitt</h2>
    </div>
</div>

<p>In April of 2012, Zach DeWitt was named Owner / Head Coach of the <strong>Franklin Regional Swim Team</strong>, after having spent three years as Head Coach of Club Mart Swimming, a swim club based out of Martinsville, IN.
</p>

<p>By 2014, <strong>FRST</strong> had shot up the ranks and finished in the top-5 at Indiana Age Group State 4 times, highlighted by a couple 3rd place finishes in 2015.
</p>

<p>In 2016, <strong>FRST</strong> nation expanded in size from just over 60 athletes to over 110 athletes. As <strong>FRST</strong> expanded, it maintained a heavy emphasis on being a family first, athlete-centered program.
</p>

<p>By 2019, <strong>FRST</strong> had grown to serve over 150 athletes from Franklin, neighboring Whiteland, and the surrounding areas south of Indianapolis. By this time, <strong>FRST</strong> had begun consistently sending multiple athletes to the Junior
    National championsips each season, and earned itself USA Swimming Bronze Medal Status for the first time.</p>

        <h2>Colin Mothersead</h2>
    </div>
</div>

<p>In April of 2019, current Head Age Group Coach Colin Mothersead joined the coaching staff and shortly thereafter took over the Eclipse and Challenger groups and the operations of FRST's age group programming.</p>

<p>Although the COVID-19 pandemic provided its challenges for the club, <strong>FRST</strong> was able to maintain operations virtually for the first few months of lockdown and return to the Franklin Family Aquatic Center in the summer of 2020. From there,
    the <strong>FRST</strong> Family slowly made its return to normal over the course of the next six months.</p>

<p>As the swimming world began to return to competition after the cancellation of all meets and postponement of the Olympic Games in the previous 8 months, <strong>FRST</strong> led the way in developing plans and procedures for returning safely to competition.</p>

<p>In the fall and winter of 2021, <strong>FRST</strong> saw massive success in its return to competion, highlighted by Cade Oliver being the first 18&Under athlete in the club's history to qualify for the US Olympic Trials.</p>

<p>Shortly thereafter, <strong>FRST</strong> saw a surge in membership to return to its pre-pandemic status of 150 athletes. With a few new additions to the coaching staff over the next few seasons, <strong>FRST</strong> has seen impressive growth as it
    sets the stage to break new ground in achievement and service to the community.</p>

<p>For 2022, <strong>FRST</strong> was awarded Silver Medal status by USA Swimming, making it one of the Top 100 highest-performing swim clubs in the nation, and one of 5 to receive the honor in the state of Indiana.</p>

<p>Since 2012, <strong>FRST</strong> has remained the most successful age group and senior program within Indiana Swimming in the south-central Indiana area. <strong>FRST</strong> consistently has the most state, zone, and national level qualifiers in Johnson
    County.
