        <br />
        For our first major meet of the summer we will be travelling to the north side of Indy to Fishers High School to
        compete against some very strong competition. No word yet on what COVID protocols will look like at this point
        in the season, but we have gone to Fishers to swim fast many times in the past and have always come away with
        impressive performances!

        <strong class="meet-color">GOALS:</strong>
        <br />
        Coming out of our dual meets and home meet, we will have had plenty of exposure to racing in the long course
        pool. With the novelty of it fading, we are looking to post some fast swims and punch as many tickets to
        Divisionals and State as we can at this early point in the season.
