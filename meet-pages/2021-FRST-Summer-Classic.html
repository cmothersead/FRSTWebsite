        <br />
        The second of FRST's summer invitationals, this meet marks an important point in the season as we close in on
        the final month. With a lineup of strong teams from in, and out of state. We have a beautiful venue, phenomenal
        support, and wonderful athletes. FRST largely depends on great participation and involvement in these functions
        to fund the programs we are able to offer. All
        parents will be required to assist in hosting obligations, from timing, to running hostipitality or concessions,
        to helping post heat sheets. FRST genuinely appreciates your support and generosity.

        This meet marks an important point in the season as we approach the final month before championships. At this
        point, for our upper level athletes, focus begins to shift toward speed and execution as we prepare to be
        successful against the best teams in the state and midwest. While for our newer, and younger swimmers, this meet
        provides either a great entry point for those who have yet to experience Long Course racing and are ready, or an
        accessible and familiar chance to take a new step forward.
