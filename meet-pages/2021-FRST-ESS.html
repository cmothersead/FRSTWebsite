        <br />
        This is the first of 2 invitational meets we will host this summer. All members of FRST, Launch group and above,
        are required to attend. We have a beautiful venue, phenomenal support, and wonderful athletes. FRST largely
        depends on great participation and involvement in these functions to fund the programs we are able to offer. All
        parents will be required to assist in hosting obligations, from timing, to running hostipitality or concessions,
        to helping post heat sheets. FRST genuinely appreciates your support and generosity,
        <u>
            it's what makes Franklin Regional Swim Team a special program.
        </u>

        This summer we will see participation from some of the top programs around the Indy area and beyond to make this
        one of the fastest meets we have ever hosted. With Olympic Trials right around the corner, expect to see some
        exciting races from the top level athletes at this meet, as well as some big swims out of our younger athletes,
        who haven't gotten a chance to race Long Course in almost 2 years!
