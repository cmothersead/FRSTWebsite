        <h2>Learn to Swim with the FRST Swim School!</h2>

        <p>
            Our mission for our swim lessons program is quite simple. We're here to
            <strong style="color:#B22222;">TEACH</strong>
            children
            <strong style="color:#B22222;">HOW TO SWIM and <u>BE SAFE</u> around the water.</strong>
            Our professionally trained instructors pride themselves on providing quality lessons that are fun and
            rewarding so that children
            learn to love and respect the water as much as we do at FRST. Students in our programs will progressively
            learn a variety of skills that will allow them to be safe and comfortable in any aquatic environment.
        </p>

        <p>
            Our swim lessons program is better than ever! We are happy to announce that we have undergone some change
            in curriculum and are moving towards the most effective teaching you will find on the south side of
            Indy. Below you will find important information pertaining to our group swim lessons program.
